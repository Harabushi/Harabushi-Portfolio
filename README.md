# My Portfolio
The purpose of this weekly challenge is to create the earliest version of my professional web developer portfolio showcasing the work I have already completed, the skills I have already learned, and leaving room for future projects to be added when I complete them.

### Deployed at: https://harabushi.github.io/portfolio/

## AS AN employer
### I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
### SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

<br />

## GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
### WHEN I load their portfolio
### THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
### WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
### THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
### WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
### THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
### WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
### THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
### WHEN I click on the images of the applications
### THEN I am taken to that deployed application
### WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
### THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
